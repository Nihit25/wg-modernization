# Defining Mainframe Modernization

Businesses are digitally transforming to better serve their customers,
reduce time to market, and increase their ability to respond quickly to
market changes, consumer behavior, and new regulations. As businesses
transform, they are imposing significant demands on existing mainframe
applications and data, driving the need for modernization to better
achieve business outcomes.

It's often not a question of if you need to modernize mainframe
applications, only a question of how. The OMP Working Group embraces a
hybrid cloud approach to mainframe modernization with the goal of
helping business improve business agility, optimize costs, achieve
non-functional requirements, while leveraging existing investments. We
will provide a framework for modernization that spans applications,
data, operations, interoperability, and security. We encourage looking
at the business needs first, then take an ROI driven approach to help
assess costs, business risks, and tradeoffs. There is rarely a "one-size
fits all" approach to anything in the IT industry. By providing a
framework we intend to feature the range of options available to help
you to achieve your mainframe modernization objectives.

# Description

Summary of the Change:
Restructured the information to be organized by the reader's role (e.g., CTO, Developer, SysAdmin) and business needs (e.g., faster delivery, better insights, cost savings) rather than by technology topics (e.g., AI, Cloud, DevOps). This change aims to make the content more usable and relevant to our audience.

Relevant Motivation and Context:
During the December 20, 2023 meeting, it was decided that organizing content by roles and business needs would better serve our readers by providing targeted information that directly addresses their specific challenges and goals. This approach is expected to improve engagement and the practical application of the provided material.

Dependencies Required for This Change:
None identified at this stage.
